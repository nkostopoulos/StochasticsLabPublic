# StochasticsLabPublic
This is the repository for the postgraduate course Stochastic Processes &amp; Optimization in Machine Learning. This course is included in the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning (DSML) program of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).  
  
Our 2021 course will include the following exercises provided as Jupyter Notebooks:  
1) Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression  
2) Logistic Regression, K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
3) Markov Chains and Simulation (heavily based on the Stochastic Processes course of the 6th semester in ECE NTUA)  
4) The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm  
5) Simulated Annealing and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)  
6) Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning  
7) Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Application in the BGP protocol)  
8) Naive Bayes Classifier (Application in DNS DDoS attack mitigation: the DNS Water Torture Attack use case)  
9) Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
10) Decision Trees and Random Forests  
  
Note: Some exercises are taken from online sources.
